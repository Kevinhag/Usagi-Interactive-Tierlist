# What is this?
This a tier list by Usagi Sensei, a CN player who is notable for his contributions to the AL community, made filterable by various things for ease of use.  

Credits to:  
**[Usagi Sensei](https://space.bilibili.com/24889090)** for the creation of the list.  
**[u/TheScorpion1397](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheScorpion1397/)** for translating it to english.  


# How do I read this?
**Ships are rated within their own class from T0 (the strongest) to Tn (the weakest).  
The main tier list is composed of T0 through T4 and includes the ships that could be considered meta in some form.**  

The banner in the upper right of their portrait showing how they can be obtained.  
Absence of a banner indicates they are not limited and can be obtained at all times via drops (including war archives), construction, or the merit, core, and medal shops.  

Ships are marked with round icons indicating their strengths to assist with choosing the best ship for any given situation.  

Rankings are not contingent on the buffs or presence of another ship, with the exceptions of the three carrier pairs and the Ning/Ping/Yat Sen trio, which are indicated by their merged pictures.  

While having a faction buff does contribute slightly to the ranking of ships like Richelieu or Nagato, it is not the primary factor in their ranks and absence of these buffs would not significantly affect their placement.  

**Note: While the list makes it easy to compare ships within a given class, it should not be used to compare ships across categories. For instance, while the list would be useful for comparing Baltimore (T0 CA) to AlgÃ©rie (T2 CA), it should not be used to compare Baltimore (T0 CA) to Noshiro (T0 CL)**.  

# Why isn't this ship as good as I have heard in other threads/lists?  
All tier lists are somewhat biased based on the opinions and experiences of their creator.  
This tier list is based on the current endgame of Chapter 13, and as such ships with better air and anti-air capabilities are valued higher, which should be factored in when using this list for other purposes.  

Finally, it should be noted that with new endgame content releasing soonTM, as teased during the CN 3rd Anniversary stream, there is a high likelihood of this list changing heavily in future updates depending on the needs of said content.
